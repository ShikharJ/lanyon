title: About
---

I am a final year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm insanely passionate about computer science and mathematics, currently trying out a number of areas, ranging from pure mathematics to machine learning and software systems.

I'm primarily interested in theoretical and applied research, in the broader areas of Artificial Intelligence and Software Systems. I will be collaborating with [Dr. Benjamin Nye](http://ict.usc.edu/profile/benjamin-nye/) for the upcoming summers at University of Southern California, Los Angeles as a Visiting Academic Researcher, working in the domain of Feature Engineering (Applied ML).

I also regularly contribute to [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine), [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) and [mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack) where I'm a member of the push-access team. I was previously an SDE intern at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), under Harishankaran Karunanidhi (Founder and CTO), and an intern under the [OpenMainframeProject](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/) on a SUSE Linux GmbH project in 2018. I have also participated in Google Summer of Code in 2018 and 2017 as a student contributor and as a mentor in 2019 under mlpack.
