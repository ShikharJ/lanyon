I'm a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Harsha Vardhan Simhadri](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/harshasi/). As a member of the Machine Learning and Optimization (MLO) team, I also regularly collaborate with [Dr. Ravishankar Krishnaswamy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rakri/) on the [Akupara](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-akupara-approximate-nearest-neighbor-search-for-large-scale-semantic-search/) project, and with [Dr. Rahul Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahsha/) on the [SeeDot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/seedot-compiler-for-low-precision-machine-learning/) project.

I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm primarily interested in theoretical and applied research, in the broader areas of Artificial Intelligence and Systems. I'm currently working on providing a theoretical explanation behind the efficiency of a certain class of graph-based indexing algorithms. In the past, I've worked on [bringing efficient ML techniques to resource constrained edge devices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/seeing-on-tiny-battery-powered-microcontrollers-with-rnnpool/?OCID=msr_blog_RNNPool_NeurIPS_tw) with [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/) as a research intern.

I have also previously collaborated with [Dr. Benjamin Nye](http://ict.usc.edu/profile/benjamin-nye/) at University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT). Long ago, I was an SDE intern at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [OpenMainframeProject](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/), and have participated in Google Summer of Code, twice as a student contributor, and once as a mentor.
