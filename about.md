I am a final year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm insanely passionate about computer science and mathematics, currently trying out a number of areas, ranging from pure mathematics to machine learning and software systems.

I'm primarily interested in theoretical and applied research, in the broader areas of Artificial Intelligence and Software Systems. I previously collaborated with [Dr. Benjamin Nye](http://ict.usc.edu/profile/benjamin-nye/) during the summer of 2019 at University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) as a Visiting Academic researcher, working in the domain of feature engineering (applied ML) on the Service for Measurement and Adaptation to Real-Time Engagement (SMART-E) project.

I also try to regularly contribute to [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine), [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) and [mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack) where I'm a member of the push-access team. I was previously an SDE intern at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), under Harishankaran Karunanidhi (CTO), and an intern under the [OpenMainframeProject](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/) on a SUSE Linux GmbH project in 2018. I have also participated in Google Summer of Code in 2018 and 2017 as a student contributor to mlpack and SymEngine respectively, and as a mentor in 2019 under mlpack.
