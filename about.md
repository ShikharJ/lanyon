I am a junior year student at Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm insanely passionate about computer programming, currently trying out a number of areas, ranging from pure mathematics to machine learning. I'm also regularly contribute to [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine), [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) and [mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack) where I'm also a member of the push-access team. I was an SDE intern at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) for the summer of 2018, under Harishankaran Karunanidhi (Founder and CTO), and an intern under the [OpenMainframeProject](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/) on a SUSE Linux GmbH project. I have also previously participated in Google Summer of Code in 2018 and 2017.
