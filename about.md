I recently graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm insanely passionate about CS and Mathematics, currently trying out a number of areas, ranging from Pure Maths to Machine Learning and Software Systems.

I'm primarily interested in theoretical and applied research, in the broader areas of Artificial Intelligence and Systems. I'm currently working with [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/) and the Machine Learning and Optimization (MLO) team at Microsoft Research, Bangalore, working on bringing efficient ML techniques to resource constrained edge devices.

I previously collaborated with [Dr. Benjamin Nye](http://ict.usc.edu/profile/benjamin-nye/) during the summer of 2019 at University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) as a Visiting Academic researcher, working in the domain of applied ML.

Before that, I have worked as an SDE intern at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [OpenMainframeProject](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/), and have participated in Google Summer of Code both as a student contributor, and as a mentor. I also try to regularly contribute to [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine), [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) and [mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack) where I'm honored to be a member of the push-access team.
