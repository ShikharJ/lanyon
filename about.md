I am a sophomore year student at Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm insanely  passionate about computer programming, currently trying my hand in a number of fields, ranging from web development to competitive programming. I'm also enthusiastic about the world of Open Source and regularly contribute to [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine), [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) and [mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack). I'll be interning at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) for the upcoming summers, under Harishankaran Karunanidhi (Founder and CTO).
