I am a freshman year student at Indian Institute of Technology, Patna. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am insanely  passionate about computer programming, currently trying my hand in a number of fields, ranging from web development to competitive programming. I'm also enthusiastic about the world of Open Source and have recently started contributing to [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine) and [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy).
