I am a freshman year student at Indian Institute of Technology, Patna. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am insanely  passionate about computer programming, currently trying my hand in a number of fields, ranging from backend web development to competitive programming competitions. I'm also enthusiastic about the world of Open Source and have recently started contributing to SymEngine.
