Hi there! 

The Google Summer of Code accepted proposals are out and I have been selected. As mentioned in a previous post, my project, `Improving SymEngine's Python Wrappers and SymPy-SymEngine Integration` has been selected and I'll get to work with [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine) and [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) communities.

### Exciting Times!

I really thank the community for accepting me as a freshman to do a project. The community over at SymPy is so helpful and the working environment real fun that has motivated me to take up this project.<br/>
My mentors are [Sumith Kulal](https://github.com/sumith1896) and [Isuru Fernando](https://github.com/isuruf), both of them being previous GSoC-cers at SymEngine (then CSymPy).

I'd also like to congratulate [Ranjith](https://github.com/ranjithkumar007), for getting a project under SymEngine and all others who have been selected under SymPy in general.

### SymPy and SymEngine

<img style="float: right" src="/assets/gsoc/sympy.png">

> SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured **[Computer Algebra System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system)** (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.

> [SymEngine](https://github.com/sympy/symengine) is a fast symbolic manipulation library, written in C++.
Plans to be the fast swappable SymPy core and also a CAS on it's own. We are currently writing Ruby and Julia wrappers for it too.

Looking forward to a great summer!
