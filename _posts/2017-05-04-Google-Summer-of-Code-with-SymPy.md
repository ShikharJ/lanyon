Hi! 

The Google Summer of Code accepted proposals are out and I have been selected. As mentioned in a previous post, my project, `Improving SymEngine's Python Wrappers and SymPy-SymEngine Integration` has been selected and I'll get to work with [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine) and [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) communities.

### Exciting Times!

I really thank the community for accepting me as a freshman to work on a project. The community over at `SymPy` and `SymEngine` is really helpful and motivating.

My mentors are [Sumith Kulal](https://github.com/sumith1896) and [Isuru Fernando](https://github.com/isuruf), both of them being previous GSoC-ers at `SymEngine` (then `CSymPy`).

I'd also like to congratulate [Ranjith](https://github.com/ranjithkumar007), for getting a project under `SymEngine` and all others who have been selected under `SymPy` in general.

### SymPy and SymEngine

<img style="float: right" src="/assets/sympy.png">

> `SymPy` is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured **[Computer Algebra System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system)** (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.

> `SymEngine` is a fast symbolic manipulation library, written in C++. Optional thin wrappers allow usage of the library from other languages. It plans to serve as a symbolic backend for the `SymPy` CAS.

Looking forward to a great summer!
