title: GSoC Progress - Week 5
---

Hello, this post contains the fifth report of my GSoC progress. This week, my work was mostly limited to `SymEngine.py`, and as such this post will be rather short.

## Report

### SymEngine.py
I pushed in [#168](https://github.com/symengine/symengine.py/pull/168) wrapping off `Logic` classes as well as the `Set` classes. Though the PR is not complete yet, currently only test cases are remaining to be written, along with some probable debugging.

Once this PR is merged in, only some miscellaneous functions from `SymEngine` would remain to be wrapped, after which our focus can be shifted to the pending `SymPy` PRs using `SymEngine`.

Till Next Time!

**Tsch√ºs**
