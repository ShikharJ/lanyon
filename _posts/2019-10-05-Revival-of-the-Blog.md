title:  Revival of the Blog
---

It's been more than a couple of years now since I last wrote a [blog post](https://shikharj.github.io/2017/08/29/Wrapping-Up-GSoC/) detailing my experiences in `GSoC` 2017. After wrapping up with that, I pretty much gave up on writing regular blog posts until now. So what changed in that time?

## New Experiences
My first `GSoC` experience gave me a lot of confidence and exposure to the world of open-source and programming. As such, I went on to participate as a student in 2018 under [`mlpack`](https://www.mlpack.org/) and also interned at [`Hackerrank`](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [`OpenMainframeProject`](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/). I also wrapped up mentoring two students for `mlpack` this year. It has been an enriching experience for me to learn so much while collaborating with the best people around the world.

## Changed Outlook
During my internship at `Hackerrank`, I realized that software development wasn't something that motivated me heavily. Even though the people I met there were some of the very skilled I had interacted with, I found myself lost and unenergetic (which in part might have also been because of my picky attitude when it comes to working on problems). Since, I was also a `GSoC` student that summer, I ended up discovering my love for mathematics, and machine learning while contributing to `mlpack`. That experience only made me realize my affinity for theoretical work, which I later affirmed during my internship at University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies (USC-ICT).

While the work at ICT wasn't super-theoretical as I had hoped, I thoroughly enjoyed myself working on open ended research problems, while writing code to test out different hypotheses. I'm heavily motivated for a career in theoretical research, and currently I'm building the prerequisite math background for the same.

## The Future
One of the many reasons why I wanted to revive this blog is to help me exposit and explain the concepts that I spend time learning on in my journey, and help other academic nomads like me to get up and running with a theory heavy background, while not having been already superb at higher level mathematics while in school. As such, I would also try and post resources that I find useful, in hopes that they might help others in their journey.
