title:  Hello Blogging!
---
My very first blog post. This blog's purpose is primarily to track the progress of my GSoC project and get feedback from my mentors, if my proposal gets selected. I propose to improve upon the Python wrappers for SymEngine, and work on rooting SymEngine as a symbolic backend for SymPy CAS, the purpose for which it has been in development for a number of years. My proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2017-Application-Shikhar-Jaiswal:-Improving-SymEngine's-Python-Wrappers-and-SymPy-SymEngine-Integration). 

Till Next Time!
