title: Literature Recommendation - An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani

This post should formally begin with a disclaimer, this book is merely intended as a rather easy introduction to applying Statistics and Probability in solving certain problems in Machine Learning. The authors themselves mention that the manuscript was developed as a gentler sloped prequel to their seminal work `The Elements of Statistical Learning` by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, which is a rather heavy-hitting book when it comes to mathematical density and depth.

While the book doesn't mention any essential prerequisites, I would strongly recommend having prior familiarity with undergraduate level Probability theory, as the book only explains the concepts in passable manner. The chapters are pretty self-contained and can make up for really quick reads. Most of the material covered is a smaller, toned-down, applied version of the mathematical machinery depicted in the book mentioned above.

## The Writing Style
Since the focus is on Applied Machine Learning, there aren't any proofs provided in the text. Also, throughout the text, the authors openly mention a concept without ever diving into it, or providing an idea behind the formulation. Concepts like `Confidence Interval`, `P-Value` and so on are freely used without providing a procedure for calculating them manually. While this can surely be a frustrating experience for less experienced people or folks who have learned and forgotten most of these concepts, the text still provides a reasonable amount of illumination when it comes down to individual topics, which are segregated into separate chapters for a better treatment. Overall, the book is a quite smooth read, and shouldn't pose much of a challenge to a sophomore level student of undergraduate CS.

In conclusion, I would like to mention that the fastest way of reading through this book is really to follow the examples given throughout the text and pondering over them, while simultaneously thinking of different general case situations. Additionally, one can simply work through the conceptual problems given at the end of each chapter. I personally found them to be rather easy flowing, though asking difficult questions wasn't the motive behind why this book was written in the first place. Those focussing on exploring Data Science would definitely benefit from this text. For such folks, working through the applied problems might be particularly illuminating as well.
