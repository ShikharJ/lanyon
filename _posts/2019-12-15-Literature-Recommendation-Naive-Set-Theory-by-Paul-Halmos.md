title: Literature Recommendation - Naive Set Theory by Paul R. Halmos

If you've followed my recent blog-posts, you'd notice how I have abstained from providing reviews and recommendations for hard-core machine learning texts. To be honest, this has an ulterior motive. Most people with a decent technical CS background prefer to dive straight into the applied sections of ML, without first understanding the nuances that led to development of ML theory. The first ML algorithms had their roots in Statistics and Probability, not CS. Moreover, set theory forms an important pillar on which most of the logical inference engines of the day are based.

In any formal course on AI, the first topics of discussion are the set-theoretic underpinnings of predicate and propositional logic, followed by a study of classical sets and their mapping to fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. Hence to get a better insight, Paul Halmos' seminal work in `Naive Set Theory` is both essential and complete. It is essential in the sense that almost all of the information presented is extremely foundational and fundamental to getting an overview of the subject. It is complete in the sense that while the book merely provides an outline for the subject, it contains pretty much everything you'll ever need as a background for ML theory later.

## The Writing Style
It is difficult to comment on the writing style of the author. While the foreword itself states that the writing style is informal to the point of being conversational, I personally found it to be quite formal and dense at the same time. This is not a book which contains many exercises, and that isn't the end goal of the text either. The material is presented in a way that encourages the reader to develop insights while reading through the passages. The proofs might appear a bit hand-wavy to seasoned enthusiasts, but that shouldn't be a hindrance to anyone from gaining an idea of how a formal proof might be constructed. The entire manuscript is divided into 25 chapters covering 25 essential topics, with each section contained in not more than 2-3 pages. As such the entire material is contained within a hundred pages, making it an quick and engaging gem of a book.

In conclusion, I would like to say that working through the problems is a must for a good mental exercise, but at the same time, it should be taken in stride that this book isn't notoriously difficult to master either, as the author himself claims. However, it is seriously fun to take a look at, and can be read like a novel. In the words of the author, "Generally, set theory is pretty trivial stuff really, but in order to become a mathematician you need some, and here it is: read it, absorb it, and then forget it".
