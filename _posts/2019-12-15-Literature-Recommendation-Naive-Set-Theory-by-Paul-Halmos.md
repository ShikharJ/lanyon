title: Literature Recommendation - Naive Set Theory by Paul R. Halmos
---

If you've followed my recent blog-posts, you'd notice how I have abstained from providing reviews and recommendations for hard-core machine learning texts. To be honest, this has an ulterior motive. Most people with a decent technical CS background prefer to dive straight into the applied sections of ML, without first understanding the nuances that led to development of ML theory. The first ML algorithms had their roots in Statistics and Probability, not CS. Moreover, set theory forms an important pillar on which most of the logical inference engines of the day are based.

In any formal course on AI, the first topics of discussion are the set-theoretic underpinnings of predicate and propositional logic, followed by a study of classical sets and their mapping to fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. Hence to get a better insight, Paul Halmos' seminal work in `Naive Set Theory` is both essential and complete, while being a misnomer. It is essential in the sense that almost all of the information presented is extremely foundational and fundamental to getting an overview of modern day `Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory`. It is complete in the sense that while the book merely provides an outline for the subject, it contains pretty much everything you'll ever need as a background for most mathematical theory later. It is a misnomer in the sense, that it is a naive introduction to `ZFC` rather than being an introduction to `Pre-Axiomatic Set Theory`.

## The Writing Style
It is difficult to comment on the writing style of the author. While the foreword itself states that the writing style is informal to the point of being conversational, I personally found it to be quite formal and dense at the same time. This is not a book which contains many exercises, and that isn't the end goal of the text either. The material is presented in a way that encourages the reader to develop insights while reading. Note that this can be a hindrance as well. The author omits the `Axiom of Foundation` in the formal sense from the book, with only minor hints being provided about the possibility of such an axiom. Moreover, in `ZFC` the only object that can be a member of a set, is another set. While the author mentions that the discussion proceeds keeping only sets in mind, nowhere is this fact explicitly mentioned.

The proofs might appear a bit hand-wavy to seasoned enthusiasts, but that shouldn't be a hindrance to anyone from gaining an idea of how a formal proof might be constructed. The entire manuscript is divided into 25 chapters covering 25 essential topics, with each section contained in not more than 3-4 pages. As such the entire material is contained within a hundred pages, making it an quick and engaging gem of a book.

## Important Sections

### Chapters 1-2


### Chapters 3-5


### Chapters 6-10


### Chapters 11-13


### Chapters 14-18


### Chapters 19-21


### Chapters 22-23


### Chapters 24-25



At the end, I should also mention that I personally cross-checked my understanding of the material by glancing through Christoper Wilson's `Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)` report [A Brief Introduction To ZFC](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2016/REUPapers/Wilson.pdf) undertaken at University of Chicago in 2016. It should be taken in stride that while Halmos claims that the book isn't notoriously difficult to master, it can be pretty polarizing to a beginning student of mathematics. However, it is seriously fun to take a look at, and can be read like a novel. In the words of the author, "Generally, set theory is pretty trivial stuff really, but in order to become a mathematician you need some, and here it is: read it, absorb it, and then forget it".
